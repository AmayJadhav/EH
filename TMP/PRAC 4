PRACTICAL NO 4
AIM: Port Scanning with NMap 
•Use NMap to perform an ACK scan to determine if a port is filtered, unfiltered, or open. 
•Perform SYN, FIN, NULL, and XMAS scans to identify open ports and their characteristics. 
•Analyze the scan results to gather information about the target system's network services

SOLUTION:
Download and install nmap from the website : https://nmap.org/download#windows
1) ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan)
It never determines open ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, determining which ports are filtered
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org


2) SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS)
SYN Scan is the default and most popular scan options for good reasons . It can be performed quickly , scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls
Command : nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org


3) FIN (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit
Command: nmap -sF -T4 scanme.name.org


4) NULL Scan (-sN)
Does not set any bits (TCP Flag Header is 0)
Command : nmap -sN -p 22 scanme.nmap.org


5) XMAS Scan (-xS)
Sets the FIN, PSH and URG flags, lightning the packet up like a Christmas tree
Command : nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org
